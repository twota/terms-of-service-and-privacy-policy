Terms of Service and End-User License Agreement (EULA)

----------------------------

Effective Date: July 5, 2025

Welcome to "Twota" ©, a social networking platform with a built-in dating feature designed to help users connect for dating, friendship, or both. By downloading, accessing, or using "Twota", you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions ("Terms").

These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Twota Technologies Inc., a company incorporated in British Columbia, Canada ("Twota", "we", "us", or "our"). If you disagree with these Terms, you must not use the "Twota".

1. Introduction

Twota Technologies Inc. operates the "Twota" app, available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The app includes the following features:

▪"Explore": Browse users filtered by sexuality, age, distance, and other preferences using our intelligent matching algorithm. Like or dislike users — mutual likes result in a match.

▪"LiveChat": Connect in real time with online users who match your sexuality, age, and distance preferences.

▪"BlindDate": A weekly anonymous match every Friday, displaying only your name and a blurred photo. To initiate a chat with a BlindDate match, you must be a verified user.

▪"Messages": Enables users who have mutually matched to communicate through private conversations within the app.

"Twota" is committed to fostering respectful, safe, secure, and meaningful interactions, and may adopt, modify, or enhance features at any time without prior notice.

2. Acceptance of Terms

By using the "Twota", you confirm that:

▪You have read, understood, and accepted these Terms.

▪These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement.

▪Continued use after updates constitutes continued acceptance.

We may revise these Terms at any time. Any changes will be communicated through the app or via email. By continuing to use the app after changes are made, you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the app immediately.

Arbitration Clause: By agreeing to these Terms, you waive any right to a jury trial or participation in class actions or class-wide arbitration. Arbitration will be on an individual basis only.

3. Eligibility

To use "Twota", you must:

▪Be at least 18 years old.

▪Be legally capable of entering into binding agreements.

▪Comply with all applicable local, provincial, federal, and international laws.

▪Provide truthful, accurate and up-to-date information in your profile and chats.

▪Not have been previously banned or removed from our services.

▪Not impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation.

We reserve the right to verify your age and identity at any time. Any violation of these requirements may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account without notice or refund.

4. User Accounts

4.1 Account Creation

To use "Twota", you must create an account by providing honest, accurate and complete information, including your name, age, gender, location, and preferences.

4.2 Verification
To keep our community safe, genuine, and authentic, and also to access certain features, all users are required to verify their profile within "22 days" of registration. Failure to complete verification within this timeframe may result in account restrictions. To apply for verification:

▪Submit a clear, well-lit selfie showing your face centered and unobstructed.

▪All profile photos must feature you and be taken within the past "two (2) years".

▪You may attempt verification up to "10 times". After 10 failed attempts, your account will be limited only to "Sign out" and "Delete Account" access.

🔔  Important Note:

Uploading altered or misleading photos for verification may result in failed verification, restrictions, or permanent suspension.

🔔  Important Note:

A "verified" badge indicates that the user's selfie has been manually reviewed and reasonably matches their profile photos. However, no verification process is entirely foolproof. Despite our efforts, some individuals may attempt to circumvent the system. Users are strongly encouraged to exercise caution and good judgment when engaging with others. "Twota" does not guarantee the accuracy of any user's identity, including those marked as verified.

4.3 Account Visibility, Suspension and Removal
To maintain the safety, integrity, and trust of the "Twota" community, we reserve the right to make invisible, suspend or permanently disable any user account under the following circumstances:

▪Non-Verified Accounts Beyond 30 Days:

If a user registers for a "Twota" account but does not successfully complete the required verification process, or fails to submit a verification request, and more than "30 calendar days" have elapsed since the date the account was created.

▪Inactive Accounts Beyond 90 Days:

If a user registers for a "Twota" account but has not engaged in any activity or usage of the "Twota" application for more than "90 calendar days".

In such cases, "Twota" may classify such accounts as inactive or spam and will make them invisible, suspend, block, or permanently delete them without prior notice.

4.4 Account Responsibility

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Please report to us immediately any unauthorized access or use.

4.5 Account Pausing

Paused accounts do not appear in Explore, but users can still use LiveChat, BlindDate, and message existing matches.

4.6 Match and Message Limits

▪Maximum active matches: 2 matches

▪Maximum messages per match: 28 messages

✅ Note: If a user exceeds 2 active matches, they will be unable to interact with new users or existing matches until they unmatch one or more to return within the permitted limit.

4.7 Account Deletion

You may delete your account at any time by going to Profile > Account and selecting "Delete Account". If you signed up using an email address (not through the "Signed up with Google"), you will need to confirm your identity by entering your password. You will also be asked to answer a brief question about whether you found a partner through the app. Once confirmed, your account and all associated data will be permanently deleted.

5. Code of Conduct

You agree to:

▪Be honest and transparent in your profile and conversations.

▪Treat all users with respect and dignity.

We reserve the right to enforce this policy at our discretion, based on user reports. By using the "Twota", you agree to engage with your active matches respectfully and refrain from ghosting.

6. Content

6.1 User-Generated Content

You are solely responsible for any content you post, share, or transmit on "Twota" including text, images, voice recordings, and videos.

To protect our users, "Twota" employs multiple safeguards and moderation mechanisms for user-generated content, including:

▪A filtering system (using AI and manual review) to detect and block objectionable material before it appears in public feeds.

▪An in-app reporting system allowing users to flag offensive content or behavior. Reports are reviewed promptly by our moderation team.

▪The ability to block and report abusive users directly from profiles or chats.

▪Published contact information (see "Contact Us" section) so users can easily reach our support team.

"Twota" has zero tolerance for any form of objectionable, sexual, violent, threatening, or abusive content or behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, pornographic material, harassment, bullying, objectification of real people, hate speech, and any Chatroulette-style or "hot-or-not" experiences. Accounts found to engage in such conduct will be immediately removed without notice.

If your app experience includes access to user-generated content from external web sources, such content is hidden by default and only displayed when explicitly enabled by the user through our website. All content remains subject to our Terms and moderation policies.

6.2 Profile Visibility

All information, photos, and details that users provide to create their profiles — including but not limited to name, gender, age, height, approximate location, sexual orientation, preferences, and biography — are publicly visible to other users within the "Twota" app, in accordance with each user's privacy settings and applicable laws.
