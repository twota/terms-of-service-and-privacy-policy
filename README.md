Twota's Terms of Service, Conditions and Privacy Policy

------------------

"Terms of Service"

Effective Date: July 5, 2025

Welcome to “twota” ©, a dating app designed to help users connect for dating, friendship, or both. By downloading, accessing, or using “twota”, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Twota Technologies Inc., a company incorporated in British Columbia, Canada (“twota”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). If you disagree with these Terms, you must not use the “twota”.

1. Introduction
Twota Technologies Inc. operates the “twota” app, available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The app includes the following features:
▪ "Explore": Browse users filtered by sexuality, age, distance, and other preferences using our intelligent matching algorithm. Like or dislike users — mutual likes result in a match.
▪ "LiveChat": Connect in real-time with online users who match your sexuality, age, and distance preferences.
▪ "BlindDate": A weekly anonymous match every Friday, displaying only your name and a blurred photo. To initiate a chat with a BlindDate match, you must be a verified user.

“twota” is committed to fostering respectful, safe, secure, and meaningful interactions, and may adopt or enhance features at any time without prior notice.

2. Acceptance of Terms
By using the “twota”, you confirm that:
▪ You have read, understood, and accepted these Terms.
▪ These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement.
▪ Continued use after updates constitutes continued acceptance.

We may revise these Terms at any time. Any changes will be communicated through the app or via email. By continuing to use the app after changes are made, you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the app immediately.

3. Eligibility
To use “twota”, you must:
▪ Be at least 18 years old.
▪ Be legally capable of entering into binding agreements.
▪ Comply with all applicable local, provincial, federal, and international laws.
▪ Provide truthful, accurate and up-to-date information in your profile and chats.
▪ Not been previously banned or removed from our services.
▪ Do not impersonate any person, or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation.

We reserve the right to verify your age and identity at any time. Any violation of these requirements may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account without notice or refund.

4. User Accounts

4.1 Account Creation
To use “twota”, you must create an account by providing honest, accurate and complete information, including your name, age, gender, location, and preferences.

4.2 Verification
To maintain our community safe, genuine, and authentic, and also to access certain features, all users are required to verify their profile within "7 days" of registration. Failure to complete verification within this timeframe may result in account restrictions. To apply for verification:
▪ Submit a clear, well-lit selfie showing your face centered and unobstructed.
▪ All profile photos must feature you and be taken within the past "2 years".
▪ You may attempt verification up to “10 times”. After 10 failed attempts, your account will be limited to deletion-only access.

☑ Note: A "verified" badge indicates that the user's selfie has been manually reviewed and reasonably matches their profile photos. However, no verification process is entirely foolproof. Despite our efforts, some individuals may attempt to circumvent the system. Users are strongly encouraged to exercise caution and good judgment when engaging with others. “twota” does not guarantee the accuracy of any user’s identity, including those marked as verified.

4.3 Account Responsibility
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Please report us immediately of any unauthorized access or use.

4.4 Account Pausing
Paused accounts do not appear in Explore, but can use LiveChat, BlindDate, and message existing matches.

4.5 Match and Message Limits
▪ Maximum active matches: 2 matches
▪ Maximum messages per match: 28 messages

☑ Note: If a user exceeds 2 active matches, they will be unable to interact with new users or existing matches until they unmatch one or more to return within the permitted limit.

4.6 Account Deletion
You may delete your account at any time by going to Profile > Account and selecting “Delete Account”. If you signed up using an email address (not through the “Signed up with Google”), you will need to confirm your identity by entering your password.
